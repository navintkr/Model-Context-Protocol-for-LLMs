# Chapter 2: Theoretical Foundations of Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent system examples demonstrating agent coordination and communication.

## Code Examples

### `smart_home_agents.py` - Multi-Agent Smart Home
Multiple specialized agents working together in a smart home environment.
```bash
python smart_home_agents.py
```

## Expected Output
```
🏠 Smart Home Multi-Agent System Demo
🤖 Initializing Agents:
  ✅ SecurityAgent initialized
  ✅ ClimateAgent initialized  
  ✅ EnergyAgent initialized
🚨 Security Event: Motion detected in living room
  🔒 SecurityAgent: Motion detected
  🌡️ ClimateAgent: Adjusting temperature for occupancy
  💡 EnergyAgent: Switching to occupied mode
✅ Multi-Agent System Demo Complete!
```

## Key Concepts
- Agent autonomy and decision-making
- Inter-agent communication patterns
- Coordination mechanisms
- Emergent system behaviors
